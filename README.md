## How to use?
- Go through each exercise one by one, they are standalone (5 to 10 min. each)
- Once you have finished an exercise, checkout the corresponding solution branch (`exercise-1-solution`).
  - The solution will appear as a file with a similar name as the exercise (i.e. `exercise_1_solution.ts` )
  - Please note that this solution is a **suggestion**, there are multiple roads to Rome.
  - Also, the solution files have functions prefixed with `_` and suffixed with numbers. VSCode gets mad when you duplicated logic in a project, that's why.
- After each exercise we get back in the main call.
  - Discuss if and why (not) the proposed solution was what you coded yourself.
